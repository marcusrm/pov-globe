In order to get this project working, we need to work together efficiently and effectively.

# Tentative Deadlines #
Friday:  We need to finalize that we are going to work on the POV sphere and order all of the parts.
February: Get server motor mount and LED strips prototyped
March: Get entire structure fully functional and get the timings/coordinate mappings prototyped
April: Get the timings/coordinate mappings fully prototyped and the software interface developed.

# Time Table #
We need at least one person to be constantly working on this project. Fill out the time table below to indicate what days would best work for you.

We should also have a limited number of days where all three of us meet.  We need at least one weekly meeting to decide what we should do, however three people working on the same part simultaneously can be very counter productive.

# Todo List #
Always, always check the Issues page on this google project before working the project.

# SVN repository #
Always, always do **svn update** and look at the **svn log** before you start working on the coding part of the project.  The last thing that we need is to duplicate each others efforts and introduce "teammate bugs".  When you are done with your work don't forget to **svn commit** with a detailed message on what work you have accomplished.
